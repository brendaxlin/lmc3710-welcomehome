          <p class="lead" style = "font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Welcome Home is an application for your desktop, smartphone, or tablet that allows you to register a wide assortment of smart-devices in and around the house. Welcome Home can connect via bluetooth, wi-fi, and through certain remote services to create a central hub for controlling as many features of your home as you can. You can make your lights turn on as you approach your front door, which will unlock itself as your smartphone comes near. You can set the heater to shut off when you leave for work, but then turn back on fifteen minutes before you're set to return. The conditions and interactions are all fully customizable, so your home will always work exactly how you want it to.

            <p style = "font-size: 15px;">
            Many of the simpler functions Welcome Home can control are able to be done by the devices on their own. Through Welcome Home, however, you gain a greater level of control, and a central interface for managing it all.</p>

              <h2>Door Lock Permission</h2>
              <p style = "font-size: 10px;">
              Through smart-locks, Welcome Home can turn your phone into a house-key, unlocking it for you without ever needing to reach in to your pocket. It can even give limited access to others, such as allowing a housekeeper in on weekday mornings.</p>

              <h2>Home security management</h2>
              <p style = "font-size: 10px;">
              By connecting to doors, windows, and even cameras, Welcome Home can keep your home protected in any way you want, allowing you to fully customize how to respond to intruders. If a window is broken, you can sound an alarm, notify law enforcement, and receive notices straight to your mobile device.</p>

              <p style = "font-size: 10px;">
              As one might expect, Welcome Home offers a quick and easy interface for controlling devices manually at the touch of a button. You can create your own sets of specific instructions, and manage your entire home from your mobile device.</p>

            <h1>Multi-device interactions</h1>
            <p style = "font-size: 15px;">
            A smart home isn't just a house with an extra microchip and bluetooth connection for every other appliance. A smart home is one that makes these devices work together to improve your quality of life.</p>
          </div>

              <h2>Smart-Glass</h2>
              <p style = "font-size: 10px;">
              Recent advancements in window technologies allow for window panels that can become opaque automatically. Why not link these in with your scheduled lights, to let in the morning sun? You can also use them as part of your home security system by setting up responses for forced entry.</p>

              <h2>Set up a morning routine</h2>
              <p style = "font-size: 10px;">
              An alarm clock reliably wakes you up every day, so why do everything else yourself? Start the coffee maker, turn on the TV to the news, prepare the shower as you walk to the bathroom, show you the day's events on from your calendar as you eat breakfast, then open the garage and turn everything off as you head out the door.</p>

              <h2>Automatic doors</h2>
              <p style = "font-size: 10px;">
              Why stop at a smart-lock when you can automate the whole door? Whether for necessary ease of use, bringing in shopping bags, or just to make your home that much more welcoming, automatic doors are a great addition to bring your home alive. You can even set the lock to detect pet collars, and let them in without having to get up.</p>

              <h2>Use only what you need</h2>
              <p style = "font-size: 10px;">
              Through integration of cameras, or by locating your mobile device, your home can respond as you move around the house by turning off unattended TVs, managing the temperature, or even simply turning on the lights for you. You'll never need to fumble around for a lightswitch in a dark room.</p>

            <h1>Respond to everything</h1>
            <p style = "font-size: 15px;">
            Welcome Home provides you with the tools to create these kinds of interactions however you want. Here are some of the things you can utilize when setting up your own actions.</p>

              <h2>Time and date</h2>
              <p style = "font-size: 10px;">
              Anything your smart devices can do can be set to run on a schedule. </p>
            </div>

              <object width = '100%' type = 'image/svg+xml' data = 'images/home.svg' class= "small_icon"></object>

              <h2>Who's home</h2>
              <p style = "font-size: 10px;">
              Through cameras and positions of smart devices, Welcome Home knows if you've left the house, if you're home alone, or if you're having a party, and can change its other behaviors accordingly.</p>
            </div>
            <div class = "col-sm-4">

              <object width = '100%' type = 'image/svg+xml' data = 'images/laptop-phone.svg' class= "small_icon"></object>

              <h2>Direct interaction</h2>
              <p style = "font-size: 10px;">
              Interactions can be set up to respond when you directly do something in your home. With this you can reprogram light switches, dim the lights whenever you play a movie, and set all of your doors to lock when one of them is locked.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class = "col-sm-12">

              <h2>What your computer knows</h2>
              <p style = "font-size: 10px;">
              Welcome Home runs on the same system as your day planner, weather app, and music player do, so why not be able to use them too? Dim the windows if too much sun shines through, start the morning routine an hour early for a busy day, make the lights pulse in time with your stereo's music! With full control, you can make the interactions as convenient or as illogical as you want!</p>
