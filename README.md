#To run the high fidelity prototype of Welcome Home simply double click on the index.html file to open the prototype in your local browser. 


Welcome Home is an application for your desktop, smartphone, or tablet that allows you to register a wide assortment of smart-devices in and around the house. Welcome Home can connect via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and through certain remote services to create a central hub for controlling as many features of your home as you can. You can make your lights turn on as you approach your front door, which will unlock itself as your smartphone comes near. You can set the heater to shut off when you leave for work, but then turn back on fifteen minutes before you're set to return. The conditions and interactions are all fully customizable, so your home will always work exactly how you want it to.
